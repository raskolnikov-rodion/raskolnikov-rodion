### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

In my spare time, I am [contributing to OpenEMR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), an electronic health records and medical practice management application.

My background is in electronics and bioengineering. You can see some of my past work on biomedical instrumentation and machine learning [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhFcsd63GAVbfUzayNhppUFQwvA).

[I don't have social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AF_aFuD8w), but you have other ways of contacting me.

Thanks for visiting!
