### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

In my spare time, I am:
- contributing to [OpenEMR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr#openemr)
- building an EHR system demo, with Angular (frontend) and NestJS (backend).

Some of the features/techniques already included in the demo:

- Deploying and creating Pull Request previews using Netlify
- Animations
- Presentational / container components
- Lazy-loading
- Run-time language selection
- Route guarding
- Form validation
- State management using NgRx
- Interceptors to manage HTTP requests from frontend to backend
- Cookies to persist data between sessions / reloads

And everything is covered using automated unit and end-to-end tests:

You can play with it [here](https://ehr-demo.netlify.app/). Keep in mind, it's a work in progress :construction_worker:
