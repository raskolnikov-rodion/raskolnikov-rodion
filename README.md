### Hey there! 👋

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

If you'd like to see the contributions graph on my current work account, please visit [here](https://github.com/dlg-gustavo-oliveira).

In my spare time, I am contributing to:
- [OpenEMR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), an electronic health records and medical practice management application.
- [Open Targets Web Apps](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ui-apps/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), tools that provide access to genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.

My academic background is in electronics and bioengineering. You can see some of my work on biomedical instrumentation and machine learning [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhFcsd63GAVbfUzayNhppUFQwvA).

[I'm not very active on social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AF_aFuD8w), but you have other ways of [contacting me](https://raskolnikov-rodion.github.io/#contact).
