### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

In my spare time, I am contributing to:
- [OpenEMR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), an electronic health records and medical practice management application.
- [Open Targets Web Apps](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ui-apps/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), tools that provide access to genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.

My background is in electronics and bioengineering. You can see some of my work on biomedical instrumentation and machine learning [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhFcsd63GAVbfUzayNhppUFQwvA).

[I don't have social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AF_aFuD8w), but you have other ways of [contacting me](https://raskolnikov-rodion.github.io/#contact).

Thanks for visiting!
