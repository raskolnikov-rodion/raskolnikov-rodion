### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

In my spare time, I am [contributing to OpenEMR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Araskolnikov-rodion+), an electronic health records and medical practice management application.

Thanks for visiting!
