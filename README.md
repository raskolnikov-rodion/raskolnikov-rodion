### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my coding playground. Mostly small demos I use to practice and experiment with new tech.

In my spare time I'm building an EHR system demo project, with Angular (frontend) and NestJS (backend). It's not public-ready yet, but you can take a peek at the login page:

![EHR-DEMO-LOGIN](https://github.com/raskolnikov-rodion/raskolnikov-rodion/assets/22417165/86edf227-648a-4de6-b6ed-a1e5eaf713ea)

Some of the features you can already see include:
- Animations
- Lazy-loading
- Run-time language selection
- Route guarding
- Form validation
- State management using NgRx
- Using interceptors to manage HTTP requests from frontend to backend

And everything is covered using automated unit and end-to-end tests ðŸ˜Ž

Thanks for visiting!
